    or blanks the symbol. Never batch flags yourself via run_labtalk either.

    NOTE on grouping: per-curve color/width/symbol/fill ALL apply only on
    UNGROUPED plots (probe-confirmed — the earlier claim that line_width/
    symbol still apply while grouped was WRONG). create_graph +
    add_plot_to_graph build ungrouped plots (fine). If this call's result
    looks right (the exported curve actually changed), the plot was already
    ungrouped — no action needed. Only when a change here has NO visible
    effect, on a grouped multi-curve plot (loaded project, or a single
    multi-Y plotxy) that shares one color/style increment, call
    ungroup_plots(graph_name) first, then re-style.

    Returns:
        Success message. Raises ValueError if no aspect was given, or if
        plot_index is out of range, or if error_bar_width/error_cap_width is
        requested but the plot has no error bars.

    once instead of many separate tools.
